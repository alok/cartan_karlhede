Implementation of the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm for determining the equivalence of spacetimes in general relativity.

The Cartan-Karlhede algorithm provides a systematic procedure to determine whether two metrics represent the same physical geometry, despite being expressed in different coordinate systems. The algorithm works by computing and comparing the functional relations between curvature tensors and their covariant derivatives in appropriately chosen frames.

This implementation is based on the paper "On the Equivalence of Spacetimes, the Cartan-Karlhede Algorithm" by Thiago M. Mergulh√£o and Carlos Batista.
