# Cartan-Karlhede Algorithm Implementation

This document provides details about the implementation of the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm in this project.

## Overview

The Cartan-Karlhede algorithm is a systematic procedure to determine whether two spacetime metrics represent the same physical geometry. The algorithm works by computing and comparing the functional relations between curvature tensors and their covariant derivatives in appropriately chosen frames.

The algorithm consists of these main steps:

1. Define a constant metric η_ab and find a frame for each metric
2. Compute curvature components and derivatives in these frames
3. For each order of derivative, compute τ_i (min number of functionally independent components) and H_i (isotropy group)
4. Continue until τ_q = τ_{q-1} and H_q = H_{q-1}
5. Compare functional relations between metrics

## Implementation Architecture

The implementation is structured around these core components:

### 1. Metric Class

The `Metric` class represents a spacetime metric and provides methods to compute:
- Christoffel symbols
- Riemann tensor
- Ricci tensor and scalar
- Weyl tensor

The implementation uses SymPy for symbolic calculations, allowing for exact tensor operations.

```python
class Metric:
    def __init__(self, components, coordinates, name="Unnamed Metric"):
        # Initialize metric with components and coordinates
        
    def christoffel_symbols(self):
        # Compute Christoffel symbols
        
    def riemann_tensor(self):
        # Compute Riemann tensor
        
    def ricci_tensor(self):
        # Compute Ricci tensor
        
    def ricci_scalar(self):
        # Compute Ricci scalar
        
    def weyl_tensor(self):
        # Compute Weyl tensor
```

### 2. Frame Classes

Two frame classes are implemented to represent different types of frames:

#### LorentzFrame

For orthonormal frames with respect to a Minkowski-like metric.

```python
class LorentzFrame:
    def __init__(self, metric, frame_vectors, eta=None):
        # Initialize Lorentz frame
        
    def curvature_components(self):
        # Compute curvature in frame
        
    def curvature_derivative(self, order=1):
        # Compute derivatives of curvature
```

#### NullFrame

For null frames in 4D spacetimes, useful for the Petrov classification.

```python
class NullFrame:
    def __init__(self, metric, l_vector, n_vector, m_vector, mbar_vector):
        # Initialize null frame
        
    def weyl_scalars(self):
        # Compute Weyl scalars
        
    def petrov_type(self):
        # Determine Petrov type
```

### 3. Algorithm Module

The algorithm module implements the Cartan-Karlhede procedure:

```python
def find_functionally_independent_components(components, coordinates):
    # Find the number of functionally independent components
    
def analyze_metric(metric, frame, max_order=3):
    # Analyze a metric using the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm
    
def compare_metrics(metric1, frame1, metric2, frame2, max_order=3):
    # Compare two metrics to determine if they are equivalent
```

### 4. Examples Module

The examples module implements various test cases and examples from the paper:

```python
def create_schwarzschild_metric():
    # Create Schwarzschild metric
    
def create_3d_example_metrics():
    # Create 3D example metrics
    
def create_schwarzschild_null_frames(metric, alt_metric):
    # Create null frames for Schwarzschild metrics
    
def compare_schwarzschild_examples():
    # Compare Schwarzschild metrics
    
def compare_3d_examples():
    # Compare 3D example metrics
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Symbolic Computation**: We use SymPy for symbolic tensor operations to obtain exact results rather than numerical approximations.

2. **Dictionary Representation**: Tensor components are stored in dictionaries with tuple indices for efficient sparse representation.

3. **Lazy Computation**: Tensor quantities are computed on demand and cached to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Frame-Based Approach**: The algorithm is implemented using frames to match the mathematical description in the paper.

5. **Modular Architecture**: The separation of metrics, frames, algorithm, and examples provides a clean, modular design.

## Simplifications and Limitations

Several simplifications were made in this implementation:

1. **τ_i Calculation**: Computing the minimum value of t_i (τ_i) requires testing all possible frames, which is computationally intensive. This implementation approximates τ_i as t_i.

2. **Isotropy Group**: Finding the isotropy group at each step requires sophisticated group theory algorithms. This implementation provides a framework where these groups could be calculated but doesn't fully implement the computation.

3. **Covariant Derivatives**: The covariant derivatives are computed in a simplified way that works for coordinate-aligned frames but would need to be expanded for general frames.

4. **Functional Relations**: The determination of functional relations between curvature components is simplified, as the general case requires advanced algebraic techniques.

## Future Work

Future improvements to the implementation include:

1. Robust computation of τ_i by minimizing over all possible frames
2. Complete implementation of isotropy group calculations
3. More sophisticated computation of covariant derivatives using connection forms
4. Better determination of functional relations between curvature components
5. Implementation of more examples from the paper, including the complex 4D cases
6. Addition of visualization tools for curvature components and functional relations
